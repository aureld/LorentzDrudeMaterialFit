# LorentzDrudeMaterialFit
Genetic algorithm C# used to fit material refractive index data to the Lorentz-Drude dispersion model.

The input file (tabulated lambda,n,k text file) and algorithm paramters can be changed in GATest/test.cs.
The matlab code can generate figures and compare with an analytical model to calculate the remaining fitness error.
